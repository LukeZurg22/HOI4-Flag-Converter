# HOI4-Flag-Converter
A repository where I store the release versions of the tool I made.

My only requirements for those who use and download this tool are that it is not to be redistributed falsely as a virus, nor to sell it for money. This program is N O T for profit and is widely available n' free to use for whomever needs it. I do not expect it to be needed often and its only function is to convert flags for Hearts of Iron IV modding usage. If you find another (legal) use for it, sweet.

Regardless I hope the best for anyone modding HOI4, and wish everyone happy modding.
